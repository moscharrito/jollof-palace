2. Get your Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console
3. Purchase a phone number or use a trial number
4. Add the credentials to your environment variables

## Usage

### Automatic Notifications

The system automatically sends SMS notifications when order status changes:

```typescript
// This happens automatically in OrderService.updateOrderStatus()
await orderService.updateOrderStatus(orderId, 'CONFIRMED');
// SMS notification is sent automatically
```

### Manual Notifications via API

#### Test SMS Service

```bash
POST /api/notifications/test-sms
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890"
}
```

#### Send Order Notification

```bash
POST /api/notifications/order-notification
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "orderId": "order-123",
  "status": "CONFIRMED"
}
```

#### Send Delay Notification

```bash
POST /api/notifications/delay-notification
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "orderId": "order-123",
  "newEstimatedTime": "2024-01-01T14:30:00Z",
  "reason": "High order volume"
}
```

#### Bulk SMS

```bash
POST /api/notifications/bulk-sms
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "phoneNumbers": ["+1234567890", "+0987654321"],
  "message": "Special offer: 20% off all orders today!"
}
```

#### Check Service Status

```bash
GET /api/notifications/status
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
```

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { NotificationService } from './services/NotificationService';

const notificationService = new NotificationService();

// Send order status notification
await notificationService.sendOrderStatusNotification(
  order,
  'CONFIRMED',
  estimatedReadyTime
);

// Send delay notification
await notificationService.sendDelayNotification(
  order,
  newEstimatedTime,
  'Kitchen equipment issue'
);

// Send bulk notification
const result = await notificationService.sendBulkNotification(
  ['+1234567890', '+0987654321'],
  'Restaurant closed today due to maintenance'
);

// Test SMS service
const isWorking = await notificationService.testSMSService('+1234567890');
```

## Phone Number Formatting

The system automatically formats phone numbers:

- **10-digit US**: `1234567890` ‚Üí `+11234567890`
- **11-digit US**: `11234567890` ‚Üí `+11234567890`
- **International**: `+234801234567` ‚Üí `+234801234567`
- **Formatted**: `(123) 456-7890` ‚Üí `+11234567890`

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

- If Twilio is not configured, SMS notifications are skipped without breaking the order flow
- Failed SMS attempts are logged but don't prevent order processing
- The system continues to work even if the SMS service is temporarily unavailable

### Fallback Strategies

1. **SMS Failure**: Order processing continues normally
2. **Invalid Phone Numbers**: Logged as failed, other notifications continue
3. **Rate Limiting**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
4. **Network Issues**: Timeout handling with graceful failure

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern="NotificationService.test.ts"
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
# Set test Twilio credentials
export TEST_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_test_sid"
export TEST_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_test_token"
export TEST_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="+15005550006"

npm test -- --testPathPattern="sms-notification.integration.test.ts"
```

### Manual Testing

Use the test endpoint to verify SMS functionality:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/notifications/test-sms \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "+1234567890"}'
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### SMS Logs

All SMS attempts are logged with:
- Timestamp
- Order ID
- Recipient phone number
- Message content
- Status (SENT/FAILED)
- External ID (Twilio SID)
- Error details (if failed)

### Console Output

```
‚úÖ Twilio SMS service initialized
SMS sent successfully: SM1234567890abcdef
Notification log: { timestamp: '2024-01-01T12:00:00Z', orderId: 'order-123', ... }
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **SMS Not Sending**
   - Check Twilio credentials in environment variables
   - Verify phone number format
   - Check Twilio account balance

2. **Invalid Phone Numbers**
   - Ensure phone numbers include country code
   - Use E.164 format: `+1234567890`

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Twilio has rate limits for trial accounts
   - Upgrade to paid account for higher limits

4. **International SMS**
   - Verify Twilio account has international SMS enabled
   - Check country-specific regulations

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development
```

This will show detailed SMS logs in the console.

## Security Considerations

- Admin authentication required for all SMS endpoints
- Phone numbers are validated before sending
- Message content is sanitized
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Twilio credentials stored securely in environment variables

## Cost Optimization

- SMS notifications only sent for important status changes
- Bulk SMS limited to 100 recipients per request
- Failed SMS attempts are not retried indefinitely
- Template system ensures consistent, concise messages

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation satisfies the following task requirements:

- ‚úÖ **Integrate Twilio SDK for SMS notifications**
- ‚úÖ **Implement order confirmation SMS with order details**
- ‚úÖ **Create order ready notification SMS for customer pickup/delivery**
- ‚úÖ **Build SMS template system for different notification types**
- ‚úÖ **Write integration tests for SMS delivery and fallback handling**

The system is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, testing, and monitoring capabilities.
